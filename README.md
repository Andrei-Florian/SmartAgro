Farming land is a precious resource, it is necessary for the survival of the modern society. But so many challenges are faced in agricultural farming, you need to get the temperature, humidity and sunlight right for the crop, and then you have to ensure that nothing destroys the crop.

The concept smart farming has been taking shape in the recent years, the idea of remotely overseeing the state of your crop. But this revolution in farming comes at a great cost, most available systems are too expensive to implement on small farms and the systems may not cover large farms.

SmartAgro intends to create a network of devices, easy to use that can be placed on the field that is being monitored. The devices collect atmospheric data, soil related parameters and light values, sending all the data to the cloud where it is presented on a dashboard.

This allows any farm, any size to walk into the new age of farming, implementing a scalable fleet of devices across their land that can warn them if a drought is approaching.
